Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML".
Techs:
1. HandleChange to accept user real-time input and show it on the app.
2. The use of "dangerouslySetInnerHTML", which is Reactâ€™s replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM.
3. require("marked") to convert text to valid HTML.
